## Snackable Frontend Practical
This repository contains some boilerplate code that'll setup the coding problem that's been assigned.  After your solution is finished, share your solution with the snackable team.  
Finish whatever you can in the 2-hour time limit.  We're less concerned about the amount of work that's been compelted, as we are about overall thought process and architectural decisions which we'll discuss during our next meeting.
